# GH CLI TEMPLATE REPO

I am the template repo use for a 20 minute talk on the [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com). This README also contains the instructions for delivering this talk.

## Pre-requisites

- GH CLI installed
- GH screensaver extension installed

> I make use of some aliases to scroll through a gist of ascii art I created to use for slides. 
> You can find the [aliases here](https://gist.github.com/vilmibm/a1b9a405ac0d5153c614c9c646e37d13).

## Demo Outline

*Before the talk starts, open command prompt and run*

- **`gh reset-slide`**
- **`gh screensaver --saver starfield`**

"Oh Hi, I didn't see you there. So, how many people like to live in the command prompt? Well, this is the talk for you. Hold on a sec, let me bring up my slides"

- **`Press enter to stop the screensaver`**
- **`gh next-slide`**

Welcome to the GitHub Command Line Interface (aka, the GitHub CLI). All the goodness of GitHub, without ever having to leave your shell.

- **`gh next-slide`**

So, what are we going to do today? We are gonna do our daily jobs using GitHub, but without leaving the Windows Terminal. Some things we will accomplish include:

- Creating a new repository
- Open an issue to track our work
- Make a code change
- Submit/Merge a pull request
- Run a GitHub Actions workflow

and that is just some of what the GH CLI can do. But that wil take us through our 20 minutes for sure.

- **`gh next-slide`**

And we are gonna do all (or at least most of it) from the command line. Let's get started!
